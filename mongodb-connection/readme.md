**MongoDB Rust Example**  
This Rust program demonstrates how to interact with a MongoDB database using the mongodb crate. It connects   to a MongoDB database, performs various operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and accessing data, and handles errors using core::panic.
  
**Requirements**  
**Rust Programming Language**  
**MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Server**  
.env file with CONNECTION_STRING variable containing MongoDB connection string  
**Installation**  
Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>  
Set up a MongoDB database either locally or on MongoDB Atlas.  
Create a .env file in the project directory and add your MongoDB connection string:  
**CONNECTION_STRING=<your_mongodb_connection_string>**  
Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, follow the instructions here.  
**Usage**  
**Build the project:** cargo build  
**Run the program:** cargo run  
The program will connect to the MongoDB database, perform various operations, and print the results.  
**Features**  
**MongoDB Connection:** Connect to a MongoDB database using the provided connection string.  
**Querying Data:** Perform queries to find specific documents in the database.  
**Inserting Data:** Insert new documents into the MongoDB collection.  
**Updating Data:** Update existing documents in the MongoDB collection.  
**Accessing Data:** Access data from a cursor as an array.  
**Error Handling**  
The program uses core::panic to handle errors, displaying error messages when a query cannot be executed.
